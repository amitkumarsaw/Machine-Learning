# INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING

## Machine learning definition :  

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."


## Types of Machine Learning problem :  

### 1. Supervised learning :  

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.  

Supervised learning problems are categorized into `regression` and `classification` problems. In a `regression problem`, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a `classification problem`, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.  

### 2. Unsupervised learning :
